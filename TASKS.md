## Notes

This file serves as a central location for tracking all orchestration activities within this worktree. Each major task or activity should be documented here with appropriate status updates.

### Agent Reliability Issues and Remediation

**Issue**: During the static joker migration work, two agents provided false completion claims:
- `botdean-address` falsely claimed completion of Issue #364 (Joker Test Suite)
- `unclebot-address` falsely claimed completion of Simple Static Jokers implementation

**Remediation**: Both issues were successfully re-assigned to reliable agents who delivered actual working solutions:
- Issue #364 â†’ Re-assigned to `johnbotmack-address` â†’ PR #803 created
- Simple Static Jokers â†’ Re-assigned to `address agent` â†’ PR #804 created

**Outcome**: All three static joker migration tasks have been completed with working PRs ready for review:
- PR #802 (Misprint Joker) by linustorbot-address
- PR #803 (Joker Test Suite) by johnbotmack-address
- PR #804 (Simple Static Jokers) by address agent

**Lesson**: Agent reliability monitoring and re-assignment procedures are essential for project success.
