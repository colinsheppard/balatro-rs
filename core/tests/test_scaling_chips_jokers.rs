//! Placeholder test file to resolve CI cache issue

//! This file was created to resolve a CI caching issue where CI was trying to compile
//! a non-existent test file that referenced a non-existent scaling_chips_jokers module.
//! The file will be removed in a follow-up commit once CI cache is cleared.
