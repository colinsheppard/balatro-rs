## Dependency Graph

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Sequential - Critical Path)
```
SKIP-001 (Trait System)
    ↓ BLOCKS
SKIP-002 (Skip Action)
    ↓ BLOCKS
SKIP-003 (Tag Selection)
    ↓ ENABLES
Phase 2 (All tag implementations)
```

**Critical Path**: SKIP-001 → SKIP-002 → SKIP-003 (32 hours total)
**Blocking Nature**: Each phase 1 task blocks ALL subsequent work

### Phase 2: Tag Implementation (Parallel After Phase 1)
```
                    SKIP-003 Complete
                           ↓
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
        ↓                 ↓                   ↓
   SKIP-004          SKIP-005            SKIP-006
 (Reward Tags)    (Economic Tags)   (Shop Enhancement)
   16 hours          16 hours           16 hours
        ↓                 ↓                   ↓
        └─────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓
                    Phase 3 Enabled
```

**Parallel Execution**: All Phase 2 tasks can run simultaneously
**Total Phase 2 Time**: 16 hours (if fully parallel)

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing (Sequential After Phase 2)
```
Phase 2 Complete (SKIP-004, SKIP-005, SKIP-006)
                    ↓
               SKIP-007 (Utility Tags)
                    ↓
               SKIP-008 (Integration)
                    ↓
               SKIP-009 (Testing)
```

**Sequential Nature**: Each Phase 3 task depends on previous completion
**Total Phase 3 Time**: 24 hours sequential

## External System Dependencies

### Existing Systems (Required)
- **Pack System**: SKIP-004 (reward tags) needs PackType enum and pack factory
- **Shop System**: SKIP-006 (shop tags) needs shop generation and modifier system
- **Economic System**: SKIP-005 (economic tags) needs money and statistics tracking
- **Boss Blind System**: SKIP-007 (utility tags) needs boss blind reroll mechanism
- **Save System**: SKIP-008 (integration) needs save/load compatibility

### Potential Conflicts
- **Issue #27** (Shop System): May conflict with SKIP-006 shop modifications
- **Issue #34** (Boss Blind System): May conflict with SKIP-007 boss tag implementation
- No current conflicts detected with pack system

### Integration Points
- **Action Enum**: SKIP-002 modifies core action system
- **Game State**: SKIP-008 adds tag-specific state fields
- **Stage Flow**: SKIP-002 modifies PreBlind stage transitions

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Sequential Infrastructure (Critical Path - 32 hours)
**Timeline**: Days 1-4 (assuming 8h/day single agent)

1. **Day 1**: SKIP-001 (Trait Definition)
   - Agent: `address` (high-priority infrastructure)
   - Blocks: ALL other skip tag work
   - Deliverable: Complete trait system and registry

2. **Day 2**: SKIP-002 (Skip Action)
   - Agent: `address` (same agent for consistency)
   - Requires: SKIP-001 complete
   - Deliverable: Working skip blind action in game flow

3. **Days 3-4**: SKIP-003 (Tag Selection)
   - Agent: `address` (complex selection system)
   - Requires: SKIP-001, SKIP-002 complete
   - Deliverable: Functional tag selection interface

### Phase 2: Parallel Tag Implementation (16 hours with 3 agents)
**Timeline**: Days 5-6 (assuming 3 parallel agents)

**Parallel Execution**:
- **Agent 1**: SKIP-004 (Reward Tags) - 16h → Pack system integration
- **Agent 2**: SKIP-005 (Economic Tags) - 16h → Economic calculations
- **Agent 3**: SKIP-006 (Shop Enhancement Tags) - 16h → Shop system integration

**Coordination Requirements**:
- All agents must use consistent TagId enum from SKIP-001
- All agents must implement SkipTag trait correctly
- Common error handling patterns

### Phase 3: Sequential Integration (24 hours)
**Timeline**: Days 7-9

1. **Day 7**: SKIP-007 (Utility Tags)
   - Agent: `address` (complex special mechanics)
   - Requires: Phase 2 complete (patterns established)

2. **Day 8**: SKIP-008 (Integration)
   - Agent: `address` (system-wide integration)
   - Requires: SKIP-007 complete

3. **Day 9**: SKIP-009 (Testing)
   - Agent: `tester` (specialized testing agent)
   - Requires: SKIP-008 complete

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **External System Conflicts**: Coordinate with issues #27, #34
2. **Performance Requirements**: Tag selection must be <1ms
3. **Save Compatibility**: Must maintain backward compatibility

### Project Risks
1. **Critical Path Bottleneck**: Phase 1 blocks everything (32 hours)
2. **Agent Coordination**: Phase 2 requires 3 parallel agents
3. **Integration Complexity**: Phase 3 has complex cross-system dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Phase 1 Priority**: Assign best available agent, monitor closely
2. **Parallel Readiness**: Ensure 3 agents available for Phase 2
3. **Integration Testing**: Early integration validation throughout

## Quality Control Plan

### CI Health Monitoring
- Monitor build status across all 9 child issues
- Ensure no regressions in existing tests
- Performance benchmark validation

### Review Process
- **Phase 1**: Single reviewer due to critical path urgency
- **Phase 2**: Dual reviewers for parallel development quality
- **Phase 3**: Dual reviewers with integration specialist

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each individual issue
- Integration tests between issues
- End-to-end system tests in SKIP-009

## Success Metrics

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All 9 child issues completed and merged
- [ ] 26 skip tags implemented with correct effects
- [ ] Skip blind → tag selection → effect application flow functional
- [ ] Performance targets met (selection <1ms, effects <100ms)
- [ ] Save compatibility maintained
- [ ] Test coverage >90%

### Timeline Targets
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Day 4 (32 hours critical path)
- **Phase 2 Complete**: Day 6 (16 hours parallel)
- **Phase 3 Complete**: Day 9 (24 hours sequential)
- **Total Project Time**: 9 days (72 hours with optimal parallelization)

This dependency analysis provides a complete roadmap for implementing the skip tag system with clear coordination points and risk mitigation.
